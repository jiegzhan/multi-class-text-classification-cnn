Since prior to 1996, Bank of America has ruined my credit. They issued a credit card to a PREVIOUSLY authorized user who had long been removed from my account by 1996. When he got his credit card statement at HIS address, it came in MY name because when he had applied for his OWN credit card, it was issued under MY account. I called them and told them to remove me from the account because I had nothing to do with the bills. In 1996, BoA promised to remove me from the account but months later, they said they would not because he would not have been eligible for the card on his own. They admitted on the phone that they had made the mistake of putting him on my account but they refused to correct the error. They prevented me from being admitted to the New York Bar which cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars in salaries, legal fees, by ruining my credit and preventing me from obtaining a mortgage, and more. My credit was ruined for YEARS, despite numerous attempts to have BoA correct this error. Many years later. XXXX XXXX changed my account form another bank to BoA and despite it being a completely new account, with all of my current information : address, email address, etc, they erroneously linked it to the account from 1996 or prior and used that email address which I had not used in over 8 years and could not log into it. I called, wrote, etc. I went into a local branch and waited HOURS while the manager supposedly corrected the error.

I began getting notices from many companies claiming they now owned my loan. I got a call from XXXX stating that they had my loan, but it was my OLD loan. \n\nI explained to XXXX that I had refinanced and they had the information for a loan no longer existed. I started getting intent to foreclose notices from XXXX stating for the OLD loan. We faxed them information from our refinance. Our title co. also talked to a XXXX and also faxed proof to XXXX but the notices and threats kept coming and I did not know who owned for my new loan. Meanwhile, I began getting statements for my NEW loan from XXXX as if nothing was wrong and still owned my NEW loan. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX, I hired an attorney. We started to send correspondence to XXXX. XXXX continued to delay their actions to fix my double mortgage situation by sending canned letters to my lawyer saying they were trying to fix the situation. They were sending letters that contradicted each other. One would state they could not help us and another was asking for more time to research. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX, I received notice that XXXX was the servicer of my new loan. I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX notifying me of being foreclosed due for my OLD loan. This information was made public on a website, & I began receiving letters from many companies who prey on homeowners who are going through foreclosure. We filed a lawsuit against XXXX for injunctive relief, wrongful foreclosure, breaking several Arizona Revised Statues, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Slander of Credit, Consumer Fraud, Quiet Title, Breach of Contract, Truth in Lending Act and the being the interpleader of funds. \n\nSince XXXX now also owned my NEW loan, XXXX and my attorneys started to discuss how much I owed XXXX to reinstate the new loan. We never got the correct amount we owed them to reinstate. XX/XX/XXXX, I did give XXXX {$18000.00} to show good faith of trying to resolve this issue. However, when I did get my next payment notice from XXXX for the NEW loan, it still stated I was delinquent on that loan. We finally found on out XX/XX/XXXX that my check was still on the XXXX lawyer 's desk. When they finally cashed my XX/XX/XXXX, they used the money towards my OLD loan. It took nearly six months for them to transfer my payment to the new loan. \n\n\nAlso, the correspondence contradicted the mailed statements from XXXX. XXXX repeatedly pretended they were going to settle this situation, and we would vacate the court date hoping for a settlement, only to have XXXX XXXX XXXX ignore his correspondence for months. XXXX either denied any wrongdoing or had \" no knowledge '' of the issues concerning my loan. XXXX repeatedly stated they were not responsible since my loan was only serviced through XXXX XXXX XXXX and because it was actually owned by the XXXX. When we finally had a settlement hearing XXXX would not agree to our settlement terms. \n\nXXXX final offer was {$40000.00}. This amount would have not even have paid my {$60000.00} of lawyer 's fees. XXXX showed complete incompetence and did not give the attention my situation needed in order to be resolved. Even if I won a judgment against XXXX, I did not believe that my problems with my loan would have been fixed. I decided, under counsel \" walking away '' and allowing the foreclosure was a viable option. It would allow me to use my saved up mortgage payments to pay my lawyer, and I would not have to go through a costly trial. It also would allow me to permanently sever financial ties with \n",

Subsequently consumers have filed complaints against CapOne and the dealership seeking to remedy, sever, and abate the contract.

Why did Cap One agree to finance the vehicle when they knew that another source was interested. They knew that there was no real intent to finance pending a previous deal that went eerr/wrong. Why did they feel a need to tamper with the credit process when they knew that the deal would later be rescinded.

Since XX/XX/XXXX we had apply & denied XXXX times and requested an appeal on the last then was denied on appeal. The reason for denied make no sense. The XXXX denial was because we did not make enough income then the XXXX time we made too much.

Equifax is purposely changing the dates because as I stated in my Civil Suit against them, I can prove that I was at the airport at the time that it was filed. THIS BANKRUPTCY NEEDS TO BE DELETED TODAY! My attorney has been made aware of this new fraudulent practice by Equifax and we will act accordingly. I know my rights under the FCRA and I will be pursuing them against Equifax to the fullest extent of the law. \n\nI have attached the information that they are changing. \n\nDELETE THESE ITEMS FROM MY CREDIT REPORT.

I was employed the entire time on this program as a full time employer until XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I opened my initial claim in XXXX of XXXX and took a temporary assignment in XXXX XXXX and worked the assignment until XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I called Navy Federal to report another claim that I was not working on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and was told two weeks later that I did not qualify for the benefits due to my temporary work status and they did not cover temporary employment. I then explained that I lost my permanent job back in XXXX of XXXX, and that a claim had been submitted to use the benefits. I was told that they would open the initial claim I submitted in XX/XX/XXXX. I next received a call stating that I again was not qualified due to I needed to be unemployed for 30 days. I was told I should not have taken the temporary assignment in order to be qualified. I advised them at no time was I ever told that accepting temporary employment would disqualify me from using the benefits of the service. I was informed that It was in my disclosure and I explained to them that I was offered the service over the phone and never received any disclosure or had any program limits explained to me over the phone. I never was asked my status of employment when I was offered the service and was told that the benefit of the service was for coverage if I ever loss my full time job, death, or XXXX. At no time was I told accepting a temporary assignment that it would disqualify me to receive the benefit of the program. At that point I requested a copy of any written disclosure that may have been sent in XX/XX/XXXX as I never received one. I have not been given any disclosures regarding the program after multiple request. The company has not to date presented any documentation dating back to the time that I accepted the program for me to review or showing written acknowledgement of my consent. Additionally, I took a loan in XXXX XXXX and was offered the same program again by phone and was not asked my employment status. So it seems to me that this is a predatory practice by the credit union to have folks join by phone without offering any disclosures about program limitations. The bait and switch practice is to have unsuspecting customers pay for the program and when unfortunate circumstances arise and the program is needed it is only then that the company comes up with \" disclosure '' reasons not to provide the coverage or provide the benefits paid for. In my case, I have paid for benefits since XX/XX/XXXX until XXXX and never have received the benefit of the service when needed in XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX. I have never paid my Visa bill late, have a stellar credit rating and now as results of Navy Federal 's unfair predatory practice I am facing a late payment history, potential negative impact on my credit and possible interest rate increases. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have in good faith maintained this program to avoid having this type of situation occur. Navy Federal needs to be accountable and honor the goal of the program as it was sold to me instead of compounding an already difficult situation. The company 's attempt to refund fees for the service is insulting and a shameful attempt to exploit the desperation of my situation and a cheap alternative to not honor its obligation. It does nothing to resolve the situation for which I had already paid to ensure that if the circumstances ever arose, my exposure would be minimized. \n",

They ca n't threaten a consumer 's driver license and have it suspended in order to collect a bill?

I was directed into an FHA mortgage because of my troubled credit history. I was not made aware of the up front funding fee or the annual insurance premium until days before the closing. Yes, I was provided with disclosures, whether they were provided timely I am not sure, but they were not explained to me, rather I was told I needed to sign them or the loan would be declined. \nDuring the course of the process, my lender was not transparent and was often impossible to contact to help answer routine questions. I asked several times a week when I could epxect an estimate on closing costs, I didnt receive the final GFE until 2 hours before the closing. I was quoted 4 % the entire time, I questioned why the application said 4.5 % he said it 's because he had to 'throw any rate in ' to complete the application. The night before the closing I learned this was my rate and there was nothing I could do about it. Mysteriously, an XXXX $ credit appeared on the HUD settlement statement to help offset the increased rate, but this credit went directly to the seller as he was responsible for all closing costs according to the purchase and sales. \nThe lender took well over 2 months to close this loan, which resulted in huge financial penalties to me. I stayed in my home I was renting two months longer than expected and the seller of the property lost his patience along the way and threatened to charge per diem and walk away from the deal many times creating a very stressful situation for me and my family. During the course of this, I recieved a denial letter in the mail after being told by the lender the same day that I would be closing the next week. The underwriter was mistaken, and I had to provide knowledge of rule changes in order for the bank to proceed. The seller, who will be recieving his own series of complaints, held our deposit in his personal account and spent it, prior to closing. We were pre-approved with another lender and wanted to go to him but we could n't do so because our deposit was spent and our seller threated to walk away if we did n't close. \nFurther, the seller was in contact with the closing attorney 's office the day of the closing making changes to the HUD up to 30 minutes before the closing, adding miscellaneous fees and costs to reduce the amount of his closing costs, without my knowledge or consent. At closing, I was asked to write a check for XXXX $ which was the additional deposit amount required when I made a change to the purchase and sales changing the purchase amount from XXXX to XXXX. I already paid this difference via check to the seller and the lender failed to request evidence of this payment prior to closing, so as a result I was forced to pay it again and told to 'ask for it back ' from the seller ( who had been so reasonable throughout. ) I could go on and on, and I 'd be happy to, but I feel that I 've provided enough information to get an inquiry started. \n",

On XXXX/XXXX/15, I called Customer Service to report that there were also fraudulent charges made in Macy 's stores at locations unknown to me on XXXX/XXXX/15 & XXXX/XXXX/15.

On XXXX/XXXX/15, there was {$2100.00} charged for XXXX XXXX items at XXXX and {$510.00} charged for boys XXXX clothes at XXXX. The total fraudulent charges are {$3200.00}. These charges on XXXX/XXXX/15 & XXXX/XXXX/15 were made using my original Macy 's American Express credit card number linked to my original Macy 's store account, which is the reason for my fraud claim. \n\nPlease note : I attempted to file a police report on XXXX/XXXX/15 for this fraudulent credit card activity with the Police Department. The police refused to do a police report, since the fraudulent charges did not occur in our county. \n\nOn XXXX/XXXX/15, I faxed Macy 's Fraud Investigation Department a cover sheet, my Fraud Claim Form with XXXX additional sheets of information and a copy of my driver 's license. When I was unable to confirm receipt of my XXXX/XXXX/15 fax to Macy 's Fraud Investigation Department after calls to them at their XXXX phone number on XXXX/XXXX/15 & XXXX/XXXX/15, I sent a letter on XXXX/XXXX/15 via USPS XXXX Mail XXXX with proof of delivery that explained my fraud situation and sent a copy of my fax transmission confirmation, as well as, the fax, which included the Fraud Claim Form with XXXX additional sheets of information and a copy of my driver 's license. The USPS proof of delivery letter shows that XXXX XXXX received my letter on XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX. \n\nOn XXXX/XXXX/15, I wrote to Macy 's Fraud Investigation Department again because I had received my latest Macy 's store account bill on XXXX/XXXX/15, which now had another new Macy 's store account number, which I did not request. The fraudulent charges from XXXX/XXXX/15 & XXXX/XXXX/15, which totaled {$3200.00}, and {$68.00} in interest for a total of {$3300.00}, had been transferred to this latest Macy 's store account number. On XXXX/XXXX/15, I sent Macy 's Fraud Investigation Dept. my XXXX/XXXX/15 & XXXX/XXXX/15 letters and XXXX/XXXX/15 fax & transmission confirmation. On XXXX/XXXX/15, I sent this information to Department Stores National Bank, XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, OH XXXX. ( Refer to attached files! ) \n",

I 'm guilty of being an idiot, but I am not dishonest. I 'm also a VERY small business owner and in this economy I live hand-to-mouth. \n\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, my credit card processor, deducted $ 1400+ from my business checking with no warning, about a month later. That put my account into negative. My Credit Union rejected the ACH due to insufficient funds. In fact there was no indication on the ACH as to who initiated the transaction and my Credit Union had to do some research for me. \n\nI signed up for my POS/Merchant Services through a XXXX party, had no contract to sign and therefore I did not have much information to go by in order to contact them in an attempt to resolve the issue. \n\nAfter several attempts to talk to a physical person and leaving messages, I ferreted out an e-mail address and sent them XXXX explaining my wish to negotiate a payoff. I did n't at any time dispute my responsibility. It was only my wish to not be put out of business. I have an e-mail trail after negotiating a payoff that would involve them intercepting 60 % of my batches, that honestly did n't solve my problem. Plus they intercepted 100 % instead and I resorted to taking out a loan at an interest rate that 's disgustingly high in order to save my business. \n\nThey promised receipts and statements. They had to be continuously badgered for them. I did this via e-mail as I no longer trusted them to honor the agreement. I got XXXX letter half way through the process to initially notify me of my responsibility to pay the debt. Once I had paid them off, requested a statement showing that the same day I received a letter stating that I owed {$1200.00}. I called, and they assured me that my account showed a XXXX balance. Then, they suddenly ACH deposited $ 1300+ into my account. I called and e-mailed. I was verbally assured that it was being taken care of. I was notified that they 'd intercepted the required amount from batches in order to remedy this error and I have in my e-mail that the intercept would be removed from my account as I was paid off. \n\nTwo months later my bank account was ACH - $ 1400+ without warning. I spoke to my Credit Union, showed them my paper trail. They refused the transaction on my behalf and then revoked access to my account. On that day, I cancelled my account with them. Had to jump through hoops to have that confirmed and I signed up with a credit card processor that did not use XXXX XXXX and anyone affiliated with them. \n\nI received another collection letter, which I disputed, showing them my paper trail, statements and proof of payment. They continued the collections process anyhow. I have since contacted an attorney who is willing to help me without billing me thus far. He suggested a Debt Verification letter, which I have sent. After 3 weeks of silence, my account has now been referred to a collection agency and have received a call today. \n\nMy problem is that I have asked for specific answers to questions and had been assured on numerous occasions that my account showed no outstanding balance. Even on a day that I received a collection call, I called them back and the woman on the phone could not find a balance on my account. \n\nI have made every effort to pay them, have paid them and at this point I smell a rat.

When I did get overdrafted, I was told that it would be charged to my credit card versus me getting charged for the overdraft fees, which was great. But soon I realized that every overdraft became a CASH ADVANCE towards my credit card, and I was never told that they would be cash advances at really high rates. Of course they have zero remorse for not informing me of this. I walked into a branch and demanded they remove the link from my checking account and credit card account, and to stop any overage charges or attempts. They say sure, and mind you this is a Chase Supervisor, female, within the branch and answers with such arrogance, and just rude as I ask a few questions, and adds that they would need to charge me XXXX ~ XXXX dollars to remove the link. Wow.. what thieves. Today I check my accounts and both accounts seems to be linked to my credit card STILL, and now again charges my credit card.. I feel this violates my rights and what was confirmed to have been done at a branch which I saw with my own eyes, and yet they decide to charge me again. I feel this is almost fraudulant, as this was unauthorized for Chase to do without my knowledge or my permission. And I have not even received a call from them, or any notices as of today. I am not sure who I can possibly report this to or how I can get this resolved other than having to stop banking with this fraudulant bank.

After discovering the fraud charges, on or about XXXX XXXX, 2015, well within the 60 days allowed to report to the company, many phone calls and correspondence have been transpired between myself and FIA Card Services Customer Service for more than six months. \nACTION TAKEN : A police report has also been made for the credit card fraud to the XXXX XXXX Police Dept., as this is XXXX XXXX where I reside and where the fraud originated. Correspondence to FIA, along with copies of the statements which show the fraud charges, includes the following information : \" Please note that all of the charges marked in black 'Sharpie ' ink with a star [ *, or & gt ; ] next to them are fraudulent charges on the statement, including ANY AND ALL charges which took place in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I have not traveled to XXXX in more than ten years!

Also, pursuant to my phone conversation with your representative, this morning, please cancel this account, and do not open another card with fraud charges attached thereto. \" ONGOING : Every 2-3 months, instead of attempting to resolve this issue, FIA does the following:1 ) changes the account number on the card, 2 ) transfers the balance, 3 ) charges a late fee and interest, which continues to accrue. Instead of trying to resolve the issue with me as the consumer, FIA ignores it and sends a dunning letter telling me there is a balance due. Every month FIA continue to send a bill to me, as recently as XXXX, 2015 to include interest which accrues on the balance ; I refuse to pay until FIA reconciles ALL of the fraudulent charges against the amount that has been paid to the company for my legitimate charges. \nWhen calling the company 's customer service numbers [ below ], I am placed on hold for more than an hour at a time. \nAs of XXXX/XXXX/15, I filed a complaint with the XXXX ; that office referred me to the Dept. of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which I am utilizing to file a consumer complaint against FIA. \n",

The lien release was delivered to me by mail on XXXX XXXX. I called the bank today because the last time I talked to them they said they would be mailing a new title, so I called to say the title is not here and late fees are going to be assessed against my buyers. I learned today that being told I would receive a title was a mistake, I will only be receiving the lien release letter and that 's all I need. I 'm not concerned about that mistake, but mention it because if I had n't called the bank today to say today is the last day and I still do n't have it, I would n't know I 'm not going to get a new title and I would still be waiting for it, which would impact my buyers. I 've called the bank XXXX times during XXXX about getting the required documentation for my buyers. I mailed the payoff on the XXXX, they received it on the XXXX, they posted it on the XXXX, they allow 10 business days to clear the cashiers check I sent them, they mailed the lien release letter on the XXXX, and it arrived on the XXXX. This allows 1 day to get it to my buyers, who are at work, and XXXX minutes away, and the DMV closes at XXXX, so they 're going to pay late fees. I explained this to the bank on XXXX occasions, talking to XXXX and XXXX, and then talking to XXXX supervisors on separate occasions ( XXXX and XXXX ). They all acknowledge that the process was executed by the bank without mistakes and that the end result is that the title does n't get here it time. No one would take the initiative to at least SAY that it 's a problem for the customer, they 're established process that was executed without error did n't allow the customer to get the required documentation to the buyer within the 30 days allowed by state law to avoid late fees. THAT 's what I 'm complaining about. They KNOW this and are n't doing anything about it. When they told me last week the letter was mailed on the XXXX, they said it would take 10 business days to get it. They KNEW at that time I would n't get it in time. They could have changed their shipping method to get it here quickly. The problem is they know their process did n't work for the customer and they acknowledge this but do n't volunteer to improve the process. They do n't like regulation, but there 's a reason for it, and this is an example. Apparently they need to have a regulation to require them to execute a process that allows the customer to receive the required documentation in time to comply with state law without having to pay penalties. \n",

We have previously been there during a trip a couple of years prior and one of my colleagues has been there many times of many years. I looked at some items to potentially purchase and decided to buy a couple of things, as did my colleagues. The invoice from the merchant was hand written and was in XXXX XXXX Dollars and then there was a section that was converted to USD. The primary owner, XXXX, who was assisting us, and many others, was back and forth in effort to help many people. We were in the store about 2-3 hours Before I agreed to purchase a pair earrings and a bracelet. However, before getting to that point, I reminder her of a pair previously purchased that are sitting in a drawer at home for which I stated, they must have had Nickel in them as I can not even wear them. What are these made of as I can not at all have Nickel in any earrings. She told me they were solid gold, no worries, nothing would be wrong. I would be fine. She went through an entire story about all the people that come to her, and how she makes stuff, etc. etc. I said I ca n't buy them if they have any Nickel as I am highly allergic. She said I only sell the best and there is no nickel. So, I based on this, bought those specific earrings. However, being in the store so long, and getting so late, I did n't realize she also charged me for a necklace, pendant, and XXXX or XXXX rings and proceeded to calculate the XXXX incorrectly and then the conversion of the XXXX to USD incorrectly on many items. I took XXXX items with me back to the store, the earrings and the bracelet as I quickly realized later that evening, after talking to my colleagues who bought things that something was n't right with the math. As i added it up several times, not only did She overcharged me by over XXXX XXXX, or over {$10000.00} USD, there were issues in at least XXXX or XXXX items conversion rates to USD for almost {$4000.00} USD. I immediately emailed her, and I attempted to call the store, to let her know of the mistake. I also emailed her to tell her I noticed the rings, the necklace, pendant were on the invoice, I do not want those items. I looked at, but did n't want them. So, the next day, many of us returned to her store. She said she had to go to bank to refund as could n't do with her credit card equipment and it takes 3+ weeks??? I filed immediate dispute. About 2 days later, my ears were completely infected. I emailed her and went back to the store to return them. She said she would, and then changed her mind. First she said because all of us were good friends, so return yes. Then she said no. We have a video showing leaving the XXXX pieces with her at her store. Have provided the video, the picture of the hand written receipt and over XXXX emails between the merchant and I to Chase Visa, as per their request. Despite all of that, and their representatives saying they were shocked, they are saying they CAN NOT HELP ME? This is clearly consumer FRAUD. 1, The merchant says she has all the jewelry ( even though she first told XXXX she did n't ), 2, I never took possession of some of jewelry that she is charging me for, 3, she also overcharged me which is why the receipt was so high, XXXX, even though the merchant attempted partial return, she did n't return the jewelry that was never accepted nor agreed by me to have in the first place. She is charging me for all the jewelry And she wants to charge me for more than the jewelry price was quoted on the invoice picture I tok and sent to her and to Chase Visa. I am being defrauded by a merchant in her attempt to keep {$14000.00} USD from me for something I do not have and have n't had, except for a few days.

When it was finally corrected my fico score dropped XXXX points. I was told it was because I had an instalment loan that was submitted then paid off so I lost points because it no longer active. When I asked about the credit for the XXXX payments I was told I was not entitled to get those points because they entered the account wrong, so it was to late. Then again my credit score went down another XXXX points, when I called this time I was told an account was submitted ( focus group ) for the XXXX company. It was an error and removed that day but I never got my points back, I was told something else was off setting it. But I paid all of my debt off? I had nothing but good credit building. Then Just last week I received a notice my credit score went up XXXX points which was great because I NEED to trade in the vehicle! My daughters XXXX does n't fit in the one I have. The points were never issued to my account, when I asked why I was told it was a technical issue and they would put a ticket up for it. That was a week ago. I need to trade my car in and I have done all the right things and they cant seem to get their act together. I am now being told that credit is not something that we are entitled to and the lenders do n't have to report your good credit so I just have to take out more loans to raise my score. WHAT! You just told me I cant get credit for the loans I have paid and have made good of, but if I take out more you will help me? Then credit means nothing and their is no need to pay off your debt. That is the message they are sending. I need to have this addressed or I will take it to youtube and the news. Why should people work to pay off their debt if they are not going to get the credit due them by law? \n",

I feel these needs to be brought to your attention for review. \n# 1 - My first concern with my HAMP loan modification Is that I was paying my Property Tax and Homeowners Insurance before starting the trial period payments. Chase added an Escrow account to my HAMP and took Escrow out of my Trial Period Payments [ TPP ]. None of this Escrow from my TPP shows up as applied funds in the History I received to check on how my funds were being applied. These funds being made to an Escrow account total {$560.00} from the XXXX XXXX 's and on XXXX XXXX only {$180.00} is being applied to Escrow. \n# 2 - When I received loan modification papers. I called XXXX XXXX, the representative which worked with me on my loan modification process. I asked about the {$1100.00} shortage that was in the cover letter with my final Loan Modification documents. This statement included in my escrow payment of {$180.00} and I would have 5 years of payments to repay the {$1100.00} shortage. XXXX said the increase was around {$20.00} ( I figured the exact amount to be {$19.00} ) or I could pay full amount. I opted to do the 60 month payment plan. \nIn XXXX XXXX, I received a letter from Chase Bank escrow department stating I was short {$1800.00} ( different from when the loan modification that just started ) there was an : o Option A : to pay the {$1800.00} shortage in full. \no Option B : pay {$31.00} over 60 months. \nI opted for Option B once again. This brought my loan up from {$870.00} to a new amount of {$940.00}. I now question whether the 60 month Escrow program can be reinitiated once it has been started. \nNow my new payment starting XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was {$68.00} more than my first payment. If I was to pay an extra {$31.00}, this figure should have brought my new payment to {$900.00}, not the figure Chase Bank came up with that was so much more. \nThen another increase starting XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to a new amount of {$950.00}. \nThe shortage again increased starting XXXX/XXXX/XXXX with a new amount of {$960.00} The letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX still showed a shortage of {$1400.00} with a new monthly payment starting XXXX/XXXX/XXXX is {$970.00} which includes {$45.00} extra for next 32 months to pay back the shortage. \nI would like your offices to be informed about XXXX 's from Chase which is more than what actually was paid by homeowner to Chase in interest. If homeowner claims what Chase is saying and the amount was really a lot less, what are the repercussion with the IRS by taking Chases figures from the XXXX that could be wrong. \n",

Due to your company violating FCRA ( Title 15 United States Code Section 1681 ), FDCPA ( 5 U.S.C. 1692 -1692p ), and UDAPP this letter will serve as my Notice Of Intent to File Suit. Pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated, Title 22, Ch. 3, Article 1, Sections 10-30 ; Title 22, Ch. 3, XXXX 3, Sections 110-320 ; Title 15, Ch. 7, Sections 10-30 ; Title 18, Ch. 7, Article 1, Section 20 ; Administrative and Procedural Rules for Magistrate 's Court, Rules 1-19. I will be filing suit in South Carolina District XXXX Court in the amount of {$10000.00} that is to include Statutory and Actual damages incurred by myself as a result of increased APR 's as well as out right denial of credit. As we both know companies tend to wait until the suit is filed and wait until the last day before their answer is due to the court to offer settlement. I will advise you once the case is filed I will not even entertain an offer for settlement. I have already spoke with a law firm and advised them of the situation and if an agreement for settlement is not reached between myself and your company 14 calendar days from today he will be retained and take over the case in its entirety. But he will hold no settlement authority due to the disrespect your company displayed when ignoring documentation and request for validation of this fraudulent account. \nYour company listed an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$290.00} on my credit. These account were opened fraudulently and I had notified the original creditor as soon as I had seen them listed on my credit. Apparently they must have received the Fraud Affidavit and Dispute after selling it to your company. Never the less your company without mailing any documentation attempted to collect on this debt. FDCPA requires mailed documentation within 5 business days which to this day has still not been done. Now even after mailing the request for Validation of Debt and my letter of dispute for the second time back on XX/XX/XXXX I have still have not received any response or correspondence. Yet, the account is still being listed on my credit as a derogatory account thus violating FCRA and FDCPA. \nWhat I am proposing as an agreeable settlement would be your company immediately updates all three credit bureaus to remove this charge off account as well as any associated inquiries and pays me {$5000.00} payment to settle any and all violations. Payment must be made to myself at the address listed above on or before XX/XX/XXXX. Considering the cost of hiring representation in South Carolina plus the cost you would incur for my court cost and attorneys fees I believe that is a fair offer. Once a settlement is agreed to I would be willing to sign a \" Release of all claims ''. As far as contacting me in reference to this offer for resolution I am giving you permission to speak with my husband XXXX XXXX at XXXX he can also be reached by email at XXXXXXXXXXXX. If an agreement is not reached on or before XX/XX/XXXX we will move forward with the legal proceedings. \n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter, XXXX XXXX \n",

The reason for the request, is that there was an account opened with XXXX, at an address that I NEVER resided at- as the account was not opened by me. \n\nThe discovery was made, when I went to apply for credit and was denied. After reviewing my credit profile I realized there was a collection account on my profile for an account that I had not opened. \n\nI called the collection agency associated with the account ( AFNI ), to advise them of the discrepancy, and inform them that the debt was not mine, and that I never resided at the address that the service was opened. I also advised them that I was upset that my credit was affected as a result, and maintaining a good credit profile was is important to me. I was advised to pay the debt, and I felt the only way to regain good standing with my credit profile was to pay the debt ( even though I did not open the account. ). \n\nI offered to make a settlement on the account, they did not accept the settlement amount that I offered, and provided a counter offer. I eventually accepted and paid the counter offer- because I was desperate to preserve my credit profile. \n\nAfni advised that they would NOT remove the item from my profile, because this is NOT what they do- ( even though I made EVERYONE I spoke with aware that I did NOT open the account, and NEVER resided at the address where service was opened ). Because I felt I had no other recourse to attempt to restore my credit, I paid the settlement amount. I stated that this was not fair because I NEVER LIVED at the address where service was opened. \n\nDuring my initial telephone conversation with AFNI ( XXXX XXXX, 2015 ) - I gave them my address and telephone number, ( the ONLY address I have resided at for the last 5 years ). Shortly there after, I received a letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2015- stating that I had 30 days to reply to the letter, or they would assume that the debt was valid, and report it to the credit bureaus. However, they had ALREADY reported the debt to the credit reporting agencies- prior to me receiving the letter- giving me NO opportunity to respond- AND they advised me that they would NOT remove the item from my credit report. \n\nTell them that you are requesting that this agency be required to remove this item from tourncredit entirely and be instructed to stop extorting funds from people under the threat that they will and can ruin their credit. \n\nAt this time I am requesting that this agency be required to remove this item from my credit report entirely, and be instructed to stop extorting funds from people under the threat that they will ( and can ) ruin their credit!!!! \n\nAgain, I am also requesting that the practices of this agency be investigated, as I am certain that they are in complete violation of the FTC Consumer Protection act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. \n",

I have paid this company almost XXXX on a XXXX loan and only XXXX has went to my principle ... they charge customer s over 200 % in interest but word the contract and the flyer they give you is very misleading. I also revoked authorization so they would not draft my bank account and they continue to do so. I do n't understand how thi can be legal. And if so I think someone should look into this and regulate the laws. I kniw this company has had several complaints regarding these new flex loans and ripping people off, also forcing customers to switch over to these loans should also be against the law. You make a payment of XXXX and only XXXX goes to principle and the rest to fees and interest, the present the flex loan like a credit card and I have those and the definitely do not work they way this company is telling their customers. \n",

The cell phone number is the ONLY information she had to send the money ; she does not know my bank account numbers. She uses the pop money service frequently. When I told her I never received the money, she said she had a completed transaction showing in her account app. It was late XXXX 2015, and pretty much forgotten until she tried to send me money in XXXX of this year.

I did this, and the money subsequently arrived. But now I asked them what happened to the money I never received in XXXX because it dawned on me I never DID receive it. They said if I did n't get it, it went back to my daughter 's account. However, she and I both checked with the bank, and she was never given the {$35.00} back. PNC has been elusive, they tell me SHE must file the claim, then they tell her I must file the claim ; finally WE BOTH called on a conference call ( the branch tells me I must CALL to dispute or go to escalation, the phone operators tell me I must go to a BRANCH .... ) During the conference call in mid XXXX, they said the money was sent to a XXXX XXXX account. Nobody in my family has ANY accounts with XXXX XXXX. I did check my other ( non-PNC ) account to make sure I did n't get the {$35.00}, it shows nothing. PNC agreed to investigate ( this is after many phone calls and trips to the branches where notes were supposedly make in her account ). She received a letter this week ( attached ) saying they closed the investigation because she sent the money, and someone at XXXX XXXX received it and it was a concluded transaction. They told her to contact XXXX XXXX and gave her a trace #. Nobody we know has accounts at XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, predictably, will not talk to either of us about their account holders when we do n't have a name, account number, or anything, and ARE NOT CUSTOMERS. I tried to tell PNC this was an exercise in futility, but they refuse to accept any responsibility for the missing money, and instead blame my daughter for setting up the transfer incorrectly. SHE HAD NO ACCOUNT NUMBERS and used my cell phone for the transfer ; I did receive a text message saying the money was coming to my account, but at no time did I receive an email or anything that indicated I needed to accept the money. I ca n't wire money. She ca n't wire money! PNC is the one who sent the money somewhere, and now refuse to do anything about crediting it back to my daughter. Phone calls are futile, visits to the branches are futile, \" escalating the claim '' has also proven futile. Now, while I know this is \" only '' {$35.00}, if they are doing this to us, HOW MANY OTHER people are they doing it to?? They gave the money to someone, and I 'd like someone to figure out a way to get it back. I do n't know if it was PNC, I do n't know if it was Pop Money, but someone knows something here and refuses to respond in a satisfactory manner. \n",

I called XXXX who owes my loan and they directed me to XXXX to communicate with PNC concerning a loan modification on my mortgage since I got the run around last year trying to get a modification. XXXX has changed my person of contact twice but still trying to get this loan modification approved with a XXXX Modification. XXXX told me last week that I was approved for a loan modification and PNC would be contacting me stating that I was approved. To date, I have not heard back from PNC about being approved. I did finally reach someone at PNC on Monday-XX/XX/XXXX, and they said they would call back on Wednesday to discuss this but now there phones are disconnecting me when I enter my last XXXX digits of social security number. Once again, PNC is trying to wait me out so this can expire. They will then start all over and ask again for all my personal bank statements with the excuse that my time has expired since I did n't send in all requested documents which I have done numerous times. I was approved for my loan modification back in XXXX XXXX after numerous lost documents on their end with their ( PNC XXXX in-house modification which by the way was misrepresented to me at the time of application and were further obscured and modified prior to signing. I was promised a lower interest rate and they only extended my mortgage loan to 40 years. No lower interest rate was given even though they told me via telephone they would lower it. My financial situation has changed and again, I 'm going through the same drag out with PNC only this time, they are attempting to foreclose on me with their attorneys, XXXX Law Offices XXXX even though their mitigation department has sent me loss mitigation letters stating they ca n't foreclose while reviewing my application for modification. It seems that neither their attorney nor their Loss Mitigation department are communicating and I could lose my home due to their lack of communication with each other. We are very proactive in keeping our home. This is our primary home by all means. We are the parents of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX children. XXXX We have lived in our home for 18 years. I contacted XXXX since they own my mortgage and they referred me to XXXX. I have attached their information and PNC attorney info.

My name is XXXX XXXX, and I am a long time customer and student loan holder with Wells Fargo. My account number is XXXX, and this letter will address my XXXX student loans with the company. I took out these loans in XX/XX/XXXX to assist in completing my XXXX education, and sadly became extremely ill in XX/XX/XXXX, battling a serious illness. At this time, I was unable to keep up on my student loan payments ( among other debts ), while trying my best to keep finances in check while continuing to battle. While investigating my credit reports, I see the correlation of my illness to the delinquencies reported by Wells Fargo, beginning XX/XX/XXXX. You will note that prior to this year, these loans were always in excellent standing as well. We worked very hard to keep these loans from defaulting, and kept these loans under the 90 day late period at all times to prevent this. Sadly, due to the illness and lack of income, I had no choice but to pay these loans late during this time. \n\n\\It has been stated that they are having difficulty approving the deletion of the 30-day late in question on my credit report for XX/XX/XXXX, due to a \" non-bank error ''. This is both incorrect and misinformed, and the following explains why. \n\nOn countless occasions in XX/XX/XXXX, I was misinformed by Customer Service ( Wells Fargo Representatives ) that in the next 30 days they would be honoring a debit card payment system to aid me in paying my loans over the phone and prior to falling 30 days late. This occurred at least six ( 6 ) times over XX/XX/XXXX ; leading to many 30 day late reporting to my bureaus. This is, in my viewpoint, a bank error -- a bank representative repeatedly misinforming a consumer, whom was diligently trying to pay their loans on time. \n\nIn addition, as previously mentioned, the other payment methods offered to me were not viable options either, rendering it nearly impossible to pay my loan on time for this period during XX/XX/XXXX : 1 ) There was no Wells Fargo branch within XXXX miles of my residence, 2 ) Wells Fargo informed me that they could not utilize my online checking account for payment ( my only bank account at this time ), even using the routing number and account number, as the account did not come with physical checks. This occurred also on more than one occasion, and prevented me from paying my loans on time -- often leading to the need to mail in payments, which led to the payments posting late. These combined rendered it very difficult to pay my student loans prior to 30 day delinquency during the XX/XX/XXXX timeframe, in addition to blatant lies from CustAt this time, it is worth noting that my student loans with Wells Fargo have been current and in excellent standing for two ( 2 ) years now. By Wells Fargo refusing to assist me in the deletion of these 30 day late on my credit reports, there is no purpose being served other than to spite a customer in good standing, and whom was diligently trying to keep their loans current even in the face of illness and misrepresentation from Wells Fargo. \n\nWells Fargo Student Loan Customer Care repeatedly misinformed me, the consumer, stating that debit card payments \" would be available via phone within 30-60 days '' on more than one occasion -- Leading myself to assume that this would soon be a viable option, and to payments arriving late. This is Bank Error by misrepresentation. In addition, customer care often blatantly lied to me, stating that debit card payments would soon be available -- leading to further delays and delinquency.

On XXXX XXXX, I called customer service, and after answering several questions correctly, was told that I passed the ID test and that someone will call me within XXXX days but nobody did. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX from Blackhawk Network XXXX XXXX XXXX. called and left a message. T-Mobile Visa Prepaid Card product is serviced by Blackhawk Network XXXX Inc. On XXXX XXXX, I called XXXX and he asked what I used my account for. I told him that I used it recently for bill payment. He launched into a tirade about how I was breaking the law because I had used the card to make bill payments and have not made any purchases. He said I had committed a crime and could go to jail. He was not interested in what I had to say as he was focused on terrorizing me. He said that I have to make purchases on my card and that I am not allowed to make any more bill payments. He asked me several questions to verify my identity and warned that he has all my personal information in front of him and that I had better not lie to him - his tone and choice of words were that of a bully threatening his victim. I answered his questions correctly and he said that I passed the ID test and agreed to unblock my account. I was upset by his bullying, threats and baseless accusations against me, so I told him that I wanted to close my account and also to speak to a supervisor. He said there was nobody higher up than him and hung up on me. He also did not unblock my account even though he said that he would. \nI called the next day and spoke to XXXX in the same dept. I told him that XXXX had agreed to unblock my account the previous day but that my account remained blocked and asked if he could unblock it. He refused to unblock my account and behaved as XXXX had done the previous day. It was as if XXXX of them were working off the same script on how to threaten and terrorize customers who call in about blocked accounts. He made the same threats and accusations to terrorize me even when I tried to tell him about my encounter with XXXX, that I had passed the ID test and my account was to be unblocked. He said that I will have to answer to him now and that he will ask the questions, not me. He said in a threatening voice that he knows everything about me. Unlike the previous XXXX times, XXXX asked me many more questions than in the previous ID tests and asked questions that were very personal, such as the nature of my relationship with another individual, and the age of that individual. He was offensive and rude and even though I knew I answered the questions correctly, he said I failed the test. He refused to unblock my account. He also said that an IRS check that I had deposited weeks ago will be returned to IRS. He refused to say why he deemed it necessary to return a check that was deposited many weeks ago. I felt that he was retaliating against me because he revealed that he knew about my dissatisfaction with XXXX and my request for a supervisor and he implied that I was going to be sorry for my action. Even though my IRS check deposit was valid, he decided to disallow it and refused to give a reason for his action. To get my money back, I have to send XXXX documents to Blackhawk Network within XXXX hours : a picture of my T-Mobile Visa Prepaid Card, a picture of my driver 's license, a picture of my driver 's license next to my face, a picture of a utility bill showing my name and current address, and a picture showing the debit card, utility bill and driver 's license together. I will also be charged a refund check fee which he refused to tell me the amount. He talked over me constantly and refused to answer most of my questions. I asked for a supervisor but he said I could only talk with him and he hung up on me. \n",

Van Dyk Mortgage failed to inform us of the deadline by which we must be under contract which has caused us to be seriously damaged. XXXX XXXXXXXX, provided us with a preapproval letter XX/XX/XXXX and another one XX/XX/XXXX. In an e-mail from XXXX XXXX, she stated that our loan must close by XX/XX/XXXX because of the expiration of one of our children 's qualifying benefits on that date XX/XX/XXXX. Throughout this entire process, XXXX XXXX had indicated that the treatment of my student loans would change XX/XX/XXXX, and that we must be under contract no later than XX/XX/XXXX. We have been pursuing the purchase of a home with that time frame in mind and had no problem with being under contract as of XX/XX/XXXX, and had received an initial encouraging response on one of the properties. XXXX XXXX called us at XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, informing us that we now had to be under contract that day because the change in the treatment of student loans was occurring XX/XX/XXXX. Initially she left a voicemail, voicemail transcript or recording can be provided. She then spoke with my husband and gave him the same information. It was impossible to complete any negotiations with the holders of the notes and mortgages by the endof the day. The next day she sent us an email stating that we were approved fora mortgage for the maximum amount of {$170000.00}. The change in treatment of student loans is something that was known in the mortgage industry in XXXX of this year, and it was VanDyk 's responsibility to know this information and properly inform us. Had we known that the change would occur XX/XX/XXXX, we would have timed our negotiations to meet that date. Now we will not be able to purchase a home that is satisfactory for a family with XXXX children. We contacted another Mortgage company and they were able to preapprove us for {$150000.00}. That is a difference of XXXX. We are asking that VanDyk mortgage make up the deficiency that was due to their own error. We hired a lawyer, XXXX XXXX, to contact Vandyk Mortgage because after talking with BillVering, the branch manager, he would not contact us back as he previously promised. XXXX XXXX wrote a letter to Vandyk Mortgage, which costed us {$900.00}. Vandyk'sresponse contended that they were not in error in their failure to disclose important dates that would affect the amount of money that we could borrow. XXXX XXXX did inform us that it would take approximately $ XXXX to take this case to court. As itstands now we must find appropriate housing for our family, and we do not have the money it would take to litigate with Vandyk Mortgage. Regarding Vandyk 's response to the demand letter : The Van Dyk attorneys were concerned about our ability to pay for any mortgage, yet they approved us for {$270000.00} initially, then {$170000.00} after the FHA guidelines pertaining to student loan debt went into effect. Even when XXXX XXXX contacted me on a personal level to try to hire me as a worship leader for a church conference event, she at no time mentioned any concern for my loan or the ability for my wife and I to pay for a loan from Van Dyk mortgage.Ultimately the response letter from Van Dyk Mortgage discussed different issues that were irrelevant to what actually happened that led up to this point. They concede that they did indeedwait until XX/XX/XXXX XXXX to tell us that the rules were changing on how the FHA was going to consider student loans. They maintain that in failing to disclose important dates and asking us to be under contract by the end of business that day, within 6.5 hours, they did nothing wrong. \n",

Gave me a new credit card number very similar number except the last four digits. Bank of America then gave no answer for the credit limit, but later reports show that Bank of America reported the High Balance of that credit card as the credit limit. Why did they try to replace my lost/stolen card in XXXX with the same credit card number? Why did they change the credit limit so dramatically from {$26000.00} to {$8500.00} when they replaced my lost/stolen card. On the XXXX credit report Bank of America reported a third account. I only have one credit card with Bank of America, I remember they sent me a card in that same time period, I was not happy that they were sending me another card, it did n't make sense, so I called them. They said something along the line of \" oh you do n't want it? '' I said no. This was around that same time in late XXXX. \nI did not open a credit card with Bank of America in XXXX, nor did I close it in XXXX. I do n't even think I opened a Bank of America credit card in XXXX, I believe I opened a XXXX XXXX, but not Bank of America. I only have ONE credit card with Bank of America. \nI want Bank of America to answer and explain all of the above inaccurate information regarding my credit card account in my credit reports. I believe Bank of America deliberately reported my accounts innacurately. Why? \nWhen this is explained by Bank of America I may need to take their answers to an attorney for processing it legally. \n",

I responded with a complete application and documents as requested by Specialized Loan Servicing ( \" SLS '' ). Subsequently, extended periods of time took place in which I would not get a response from SLS. Over a year ago, I was informed that they were missing just a few documents including an authorization to release my Federal Tax Return Transcript, pay stubs for my wife 's XXXX income and confirmation of my consulting agreement with a XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX California. Despite the fact that I had submitted these documents in prior submissions, I repeated the task by fax, XXXX and USPS methods. Once again, extended periods of time passed without hearing from SLS. Finally, I received a communication from SLS indicating that they were unable to evaluate the dozen or so programs available for Loan Modification or relief for homeowners who fell behind in their mortgage obligations. Following this startling event, I began copying my correspondence with SLS to local, State and Federal Agencies to raise the concern that I was not being given consideration in a good-faith manner. In a effort to respond without further challenging their system, I have resubmitted a complete application for consideration in response to their request. I have been repeatedly told that while my home was in foreclosure, there was no sale date set which implied to me that they would await the submission of the new application to evaluate these potential programs before proceeding with any further action. Much to my surprise, ten days ago, I received a notification that my home was being auctioned off at XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015 which is ten days from this date. You can imagine how startled we were to being told that 15 years of memories are going to be stripped from us -- -family birthday parites, graduation celebrations, the passing of our beloved dog, XXXX , the highs and lows any family goes through. In a wink of an eye, we can be homeless at age XXXX, without anywhere to turn in spite of trying continuously being responsible citizens to seek a solution to a troubling situation.

I started working for XXXX XXXX from XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/16. He asked if I wanted to take a job that would require me to XXXX XXXX XXXX word articles and I would get paid {$5000.00} for them upon completion. I would get paid in weekly installments after turning in XXXX XXXX per week. I had completed XXXX jobs for XXXX in the past. XXXX I was paid through XXXX. XXXX I was paid through a personal check which cleared and the funds were deposited with no problems. When I contacted XXXX about the XXXX payment for the XXXX XXXX ( in the amount of {$420.00} ) he would not give me a straight answer as to when the check was put in the mail. He would just say \" a day or so ago '' and then later said he was stuck in a snowstorm in Colorado. In the past I was told when the payment was sent on the exact date and had good communication. So I started getting suspicious. I contacted the XXXX 's client that I was doing the writing for, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, just to let them know that I had not received payment from him and had not received any new work orders from him in order to give them a heads up. They originally requested XXXX to have me write XXXX articles in one month and at the rate we were going, that was not going to be possible. A few days later, XXXX contacted me by email, saying that I badmouthed him to his client and offered to steal his work ( do the work for his client without him being the middle man ). I still had not received payment at that time. That email was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. During that email conversation, I let XXXX know that I did not want to work for him any longer. On XXXX XXXX I received a check in the mail for the amount that I was owed for the work due. I assumed that he was going to go ahead and make good on his payment since I did the work for him. I deposited the check into my account at First Tennessee Bank. The money was not directly deposited and I called the bank to ask why and they let me know that it would not go into my account until the next day after XXXX. The funds were then put into my account and I used them to pay bills, etc. On XXXX XXXX the check was returned to my bank and I now have a negative balance of - {$360.00} that I owe to the bank. When I contacted FIrst Tennessee Bank they told me to contact the person who wrote the check to see if it could be resolved. I tried and got several rude responses along with XXXX acknowledging that he cancelled the check after it was put in the mail. So I have to pay my bank back because he sent me a cancelled check. When I contacted FTB again, they said it was my responsibility to pay because I signed the check and I did not call XXXX 's bank beforehand to ensure that the funds were available. The problem is that the funds would have been available at that time, he cancelled the check later on. I want to know what I can do because I do not feel like I should be responsible for the {$360.00} that I owe the bank since that was money I was paid for work that I completed. Should n't XXXX 's bank account be the one that is in default instead? His Bank is XXXX XXXX XXXX and his information is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IN XXXX. The check was in the amount of XXXX and the check number is XXXX. Account number is XXXX. \n",

'' I never would have been that far behind on my loan had the banks given me what I deserved when I first asked for it. My loan originated with XXXX and was a ridiculous 9 % interest only loan, which I have been told is considered PREDATORY. After 46 months and no sign of help from Ocwen I finally had to hire a law firm to try to get me a deal and make sure Ocwen did n't just sell the house out from under me. The law firm did get me a modification, but it does n't take me out of hardship. While the lender did lower my mortgage payment, the payment is still 52 % of my gross monthly income. According to the HAMP guidelines, I was under the impression that my lender was suppose to lower my mortgage payment to between 31 % and 38 % of my income, but they did n't do that. To top it off, they have thrown a $ XXXX baloon payment onto the back of the loan. They sent an appraiser over to appraise the value of the house and he did n't even come inside. They are trying to say that my house is worth much more than it is. While there is a mansion with all the best materials that sold down the street for $ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, OR XXXX ) recently, my house is only similar to that house in square footage.

My hope is that you will investigate this matter and at the very least force my lender into giving me a fair deal so that me and my family do n't have to move. I believe they could have lowered my payment further if they were n't trying to deceptively and artificially raise the value of my home. I also believe the $ XXXX baloon payment is obnoxious and unethical. Is n't the point of these programs to give the homeowner a fair shake so they do n't have to ask for assistance again in the future? 38 % of my gross monthly income is $ XXXX/month, so how can the lender justify a {$3100.00} payment? I want to keep my home, but I also need to feed my family and pay for bills. Please help me get a fair shake with Ocwen. \n",

I mistakenly told the caller that since that was the case the payment would most likely be received tomorrow ( Saturday ). The arrogant response I received from the called was \" ugh, well tomorrow is Saturday, so that 's not possible ''. To which I responded, Oh. Sorry that 's right, well then Monday I guess. The caller then stated well if we do n't receive the payment by Monday there will be a late fee attached to the account. I told the woman that would not be an issue. The caller then asked me for a reason that the payment was late. I stated that I had already told her that it was an oversight and that the payment was made. She then continued to ask for a reason. I stated, Ma'am, you called my home at XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX. This is the XXXX. I have already stated that the payment was made. The woman continued to request a reason. I stated miss please do n't harass me. I already stated that the payment was made. \n\nThis complaint is not so much about the call itself rather than the demeanor and the timing of the call.

A company named US Bank should know better. These bill collectors have no knowledge of who they are calling. Being a XXXX.

I would also call Customer Service and they said they would leave a message for someone to call me, but once again, no one would ever call. I was able to speak to a few CS reps, one of which helped to calculate my new escrow payment and they advised me of my refund. Three weeks went by and no refund. I called in again and found out they calculated it wrong because they were not an escrow representative and was told I was getting appx 50 % of what they told me as a refund. When I asked why I was n't notified in writing, they had no answer. I asked to speak to a Manager and he advised that he would pull the calls and call me back. I left him several messages over several weeks and never received a call from the Manager with an explanation. I also never received a revised escrow statement until I had to call in and request XXXX. This should have been provided since they recalculated my payment and my refund. I have since submitted a Complaint to their Complaint Department and they have had it for XXXX weeks with no response. While I have n't been financially violated, I am getting the worst service ever and have never been able to speak to a live Escrow Agent at this company. They claim they only let you speak to their front line Customer Service Reps and then the escrow agents do the work behind the scenes. This might be fine until the CS Rep calculates the wrong refund amount, they then Escrow Dept changes it, they hold back the check they were supposed to send you and never advise you that you are not getting the first check and the amount of your refund changed.

This money was not initially allocated to escrow XXXX future interest payment I believe, but it was a while ago ) and it was not until I called them that the issue was resolved.

I have now been sued by my HOAs attorneys and have received a letter of intent to wage garnish, while I struggle to keep the electricity on, deal with medical testing, and to keep up a house I can not sell because of Flagstar 's Negligence. Also, XX/XX/XXXX, before I put my house up for sale, Flagstar REFUSED through the loss of my paperwork three times, to allow me to obtain a Workout for my mortgage, so I applied for HUD assistance and obtained it. However, I failed to be able to regain my footing in the job market fast enough, had to work odd jobs etc. and finally took a job paying XXXX % of what I made when I bought my home in XX/XX/XXXX. I came out of the HUD program in XXXX XXXX when I put my house on the market and sold it XXXX times, each time losing the buyer because of Flagstar Bank, despite my having XXXX Real Estate advocates who have a phenomenal track record in processing short sales here in XXXX Arizona. I did not find out about CFPBs action against Flagstar XX/XX/XXXX until this week, but it seems I fall into this category of consumers, as well. I am now being threatened with wag garnishment because the XXXX Lien Holder 's ( my HOA ) attorney is no longer honoring the agreement they signed to receive their payment at the closing of my house. Of course, if Flagstar Bank continues to force me out of short sale, there is no way my HOA can get their money owed. I also lost my Hazard insurance DURING the short sale because Flagstar, who pays the insurance out of my mortgage illegally informed my insurance company ( XXXX Underwriters who are contracted by XXXX ) that my home was in short sale. XXXX INVENTED a problem with my paperwork, lost said paperwork for a claim filed more than 2 years previously with my roof damage, and claimed I never sent them paperwork and photos, even though they approved the claim and paid me ( and then they later RENEWED my insurance without a problem -- why would they renew my insurance again if there was a problem 2 years before? ) So the this required Flagstar Bank to buy insurance they claim cost them {$3000.00} per year to cover my house during the short sale, which is added onto the closing costs, thereby reducing the HOAs and HUDs cuts further. Add to this Flagstar Bank 's refusal to cooperate with my Real Estate Team and processors, and you have the consumer taking the brunt of the Bank 's negligence after 15 months of short sale. I have no money for a lawyer at this point and wage garnishment will mean not being able to keep my utilities on. I live in a rural area and am barely able to afford to keep my XXXX year old vehicle on the road. Please assist me and let me know what I can do to stop the actions against me resulting from Flagstar Bank 's refusal to work with my Real Estate Team during the last XXXX offers on my house. Thank you. \n",

The bank recently on XXXX XXXX, 2015 allowed this person to close my account, open a new account with my money, and also withdraw money. This person was also allowed to claim many of my purchases as fraud in an attempt to get more money. I found out about the incident when I tried to use my bank card to pay for parking and it was declined. I called customer service to see what the problem was, only to be told that they could not help me unless I had the fraud claim reference number ( the report which I did not file ). The bank did not follow any protocol by asking for the verbal password. Instead, I was left unable to have access to my money until I was able to go into a branch and prove my identity. After the bank verified that this was a false fraud claim, the bank still moved forward with honoring the claim. Many of the purchases, which included personal bills and other business expenses, were returned to the bank. This reversal of payment caused me to incur canceled check fees, shut-off notices, and I had to buy my XXXX back since the hosting service was XXXX of the purchases filed on the false fraud claim. I had to repay all of those bills with my own money to avoid more fees and to keep my utilities in service. Later, the bank gave me a credit of {$1300.00} which was part of the amount filed as fraud. I went into a branch to verify what the credit was for, and I was told that this was my money because the bank realized that they made a mistake. The bank ended up taking the credit back from me, leaving my account negative over {$1100.00}. The bank said that they took the credit back because they realized that I was the one who made the purchases and that they could not honor my claim. The credit was not listed as a temporary credit ( as they usually list it as temporary until they finish the investigation ). I explained to them that I was not the one who made the claim and that I was told that the credit was given to me because of the money that had already been returned to the bank from the merchants. It then became a problem with miscommunication because none of the bank 's departments understood what was going on even after I explained it to them many times. The problem is that now, I still dont have the money that the bank took from the merchants, nor do I have the credit they gave me.

They gave this person all of my personal information including print-outs of my purchases, documentation stating the password on my account, my business contacts, and a lot of other sensitive information.

The first time was in 2011 when I was unemployed. At that time we were going on XXXX late payments and the loan servicing company ( IndyMac ) sent an intent to foreclose letter. We took out a loan via a family member to avoid foreclosure because I researched that other IndyMac customers had experienced that IndyMac would foreclose immediately and would never try to assist but hold up the loan modification paperwork. They had already sent someone to take pictures of our home so we knew it was only a matter of time before they would continue to the next step in the foreclosure process. \nCurrently, Ocwen is servicing the loan and again we applied for a loan modification but was denied. However, Ocwen recommended a short sale. We were informed that we were not delinquent although we communicated in an affidavit hardship letter what our fixed incomes would be when we retire and they continued to ask for more and more paperwork. We were trying to prevent a foreclosure or short sale so we were hoping they would refinance. \nTo date, we have invested XXXX of dollars in our home so we would like to keep our home as now our payments would be going more toward the principle and eventually we would be able to sell our home to at least break even and not damage our credit score. I find it extremely difficult to believe that there are no other options for individuals who could not obtain FHA loans before the housing market plummeted and were literally forced into high interest jumbo loans via XXXX and XXXX conventional/equity loans respectively. We are unable to refinance homes that are significantly under water yet the loan servicing companies have collected XXXX just in interest alone but encourage foreclose or short sale as only options, yet we have decent payment histories. \nWhat are the options for individuals who are already living pay check to pay check because of these high interest jumbo loans on properties that are significantly underwater through no fault of their own? To continue to pay a loan for a home with a significantly diminished value or risk foreclosure or short sale and the home is resold to someone else for XXXX of your loan amount are all horrible options. We would appreciate your advisement and assistance to seek a fair resolution. \n",

The XXXX XXXX application can only be made online, and filing the application is a long, complicated process.

'' The options were \" YES '' and \" NO. '' I responded \" YES '' via email. \n\nI immediately contacted Chase Visa by phone to check on the status of the payment. I was told that it was automatically declined. I subsequently spoke with numerous customer service representatives to see if the transaction could be reinstated and processed. At XXXX point I asked a Chase representative to contact XXXX about it and we spoke with someone at XXXX in XXXX to see if we could get a phone number for the XXXX payee so the payment could be re-initiated. We were not able to make phone contact with the XXXX payee. \n\nI was ultimately told there was no way Chase and/or XXXX could reinstate the payment the payment that had been blocked by Chase. \n\nIn contrast, I paid another XXXX XXXX application-related fee using my XXXX XXXX XXXX. The payment was processed. After XXXX XXXX processed it, I received a suspicious credit card activity alert and in response to the alert, I confirmed that it was authorized. It appears that XXXX XXXX processed the payment, but flagged it for potential fraud, and then asked for confirmation. No problem! \n\nUnfortunately, the automatic block Chase places on the payee in question, a \" XXXX '' payee, resulted in non-payment of the XXXX XXXX application fee and rejection of her application for a XXXX XXXX. \n\nAnd, as a result of non-payment of the application fee, her XXXX appointment at a local XXXX XXXX office was cancelled and she could not be considered for a XXXX XXXX until she filed a brand new application online ( and repeat the hours-long, complicated filing process ). \n\nShe has filed a new application, made a request that the other fee paid ( using my XXXX XXXX card ) in connection with her initial application be refunded, and has re-scheduled the biometric appointment at a XXXX immigration office, but at a later date. \n\nThe delay resulting from Chase 's block has put her outside the deadline for normal processing time for a XXXX XXXX application.

This information was given to us in an email. We completed the process of sending him all of the required paperwork. Three days before we were scheduled to close, he called with the closing date and then said the next order of business was to discuss what our interest rate would be.

We were shocked, to say the least. He went on to tell XXXX that the 3.75 % was no longer available and that it should be 4.25 % but he would do it for 4.125 % because he felt \" bad '' that it went up so much. XXXX told him we would not do the 4.125 % and that we had agreed at 3.75 % and that 's what we wanted to close with.

Payments were made in accordance with agreement since 2013. On XXXX XXXX, CashNet USA deducted an additional {$390.00} payment from my account, after agreed upon payment was made on XXXX XXXX for {$670.00}. This caused my checking account to become negative and resulted in overdraft fees for several other purchases. This also resulted in my family, including XXXX children, to be without money for living expenses until our next pay period. I contacted CashNet USA the first time on XXXX XXXX and was told that yes, the payment was taken incorrectly and it would be reversed. This process would take 24-48 hours. I waited for the deposit into my account, in the meantime taking out additional funding from my line of credit to cover living expenses while my account what negative. After 48 hours I contacted CashNet USA again, and this time was told that the 48 hour period is for them to enter the reversal but it would not hit my account for 3 - 5 business days. Again, I waited for the deposit to my account. I was told by the associate on the phone that I had an additional {$200.00} available in credit and then went online and requested that funding so that I would have additional money for living expenses. I called several days in a row to check the status of the reversal and was told that it had been processed but would have to wait for the 5 days before it would be deposited in my account. After the 5 days had passed and there was still no deposit, I contacted CashNet USA on XXXX XXXX and was then told that the reversal had been cancelled because I had requested the additional {$200.00} in funding, which was only available on my account because of the payment that was incorrectly charged. At this time I explained to the associate that I only took the {$200.00} because my account had been overdrawn by CashNet USA when they took an unauthorized payment from my account. The associate spoke with a manager and informed me that they had made a {$50.00} credit on my account instead of reversing the payment. I explained that the credit was not sufficient and I wanted restitution for the unauthorized payment. After holding for several minutes I was told that the manager was going to override the cancellation of the payment reversal and ensure that the reversal would be completed. I was told this would be deposited back into my account within 24-48 hours. I confirmed that I would not have to wait another 3-5 days for the deposit. After another 48 hour waiting period, I still had not received the deposit from the payment reversal. I contacted CashNet USA again and was told that mgmt. cancelled the reversal and they would not refund the payment since I had taken the {$200.00} advance. I never authorized this debit from my account, CashNet USA stole this money from me and is now charging me interest on funds that I used to maintain my bank account after they cause overdraft charges and my family of XXXX to survive without money because of their inability to follow the terms of the agreement, eventhough I had been maintaining my agreed upon payment terms for two years. \n",

A provisionary credit was credited to my account about 10 days later with a letter for each individual amount stating it was a provisionary credit. They were still investigating and after 3 months if they found fraudulent purchases the money they credited would remain permanent. In the meantime we had to put freezes on both my and my husbands credit because we did n't know how far it had gone. They did get my email.I did try several times to put in more claims through customer service but was accidentally disconnected several times. I did n't want to put in any more claims until I new for sure they were going to remain permanent because of the XXXX toll it was taking on me. XX/XX/XXXX I received individual letters for each individual amount stating that the investigation was complete and the credits would remain permanent. May I add that during this time I would call Customer Service making them aware that there was additional claims to be put in still. \nImmediately following the XX/XX/XXXX decision I started putting in more claims. I was aware that it was after the 60 days but these were not your normal circumstances. I received the affidavit filled it out sent it back but that was as far as it went. A month went by and I heard nothing. How can they just not respond? As I am still waiting on a response I get a phone call XXXX. My file was sent to her and she just wanted the backstory of everything. So I gave it to her. She assured me XXXX times she was going to do everything she could for me. Not to worry. All of the additional claims were going to go through her at this point. Im thinking great i do n't have to deal with customer service being rude or hanging up on me or asking me questions which is not there job. This will all be over soon I will get my money back and can put this behind me. Reminding you that I am on XXXX. as of now I have been XXXX my body aches all day long and I ca n't sleep. The worst thing I can do is add stress to my life. Instantly I have XXXX. It takes me 4 weeks to get ahold of this women again. I think I am supposed to put the claims in through her. I finally reach her she says oh no thats my fault all claims still need to initially be put in through customer service. I just wasted XXXX more weeks. I faxed her paperwork straight from the bank. She lost it. Had to do it again. Finally I get a letter in XXXX about those claims that was dated XX/XX/XXXX that they were denied because it was passed 60 days. Then theeir is another claim she just completely ignored. I would call her leave messages sometimes 6 a day. Never got a call back. She never worked on my file. The latest thing to happen was the last set of claims was put back in my account end of XXXX. XXXX. Then it was taken out without notice on XX/XX/XXXX. I was blindsided. \n",

        "consumer_complaint_narrative": "I am submitting a complaint against Bank of America for a few reasons that are related to bounced check fees. First of all, I feel {$35.00} is an outrageously high fee for a bounced check, especially since the bank does not make it a practice to cover the checks in any way. Also, Rhode Island State law limits to {$25.00} the amount of money a merchant can charge a customer for a returned check. Therefore, I feel it is only fair that the banks be limited by the same statute. Specifically in this situation, I had written a check to a merchant who then only submitted it to his bank several weeks later. Because I was n't expecting it several weeks later, check # XXXX bounced on XXXX and again on XXXX. I take issue with the timing in which I was notified by electronic banking because both charges showed up on the same morning of XXXX. If the first attempt had been apparent on electronic banking in sequence, I would have been able to cover the amount and prevent the second bounced check from occurring. In other words, I find it strange that both attempts of cashing the check became evident at the same time on my electronic banking. It means the bank is being inconsistent in its timing of presenting information to customers via electronic banking, and this peculiar timing ends up making the bank a profit as a consequence. Moreover, these XXXX fees totaling {$70.00} resulted in a third check, # XXXX written for {$75.00}, to bounce as well. As it stands now, I have XXXX bank fees totaling {$100.00}, and my daughter may lose her spot in the after school program as a result of the check being insufficient. For one of the largest banks in the country that gambled with my hard-earned tax money, subsequently blundered, and then was bailed out, one hopes it would be more lenient in dealing with customers ' relatively minuscule mistakes. I sincerely hope that XXXX XXXX becomes President of the USA and breaks these \" much bigger than before '' banks up into smaller businesses that know how to act more fiscally and socially responsible. As far as resolution to this matter, I am interested to know the names of the banks who submitted these checks through my account. For if it was Bank of America itself, then we have a serious conflict of interest. Next, I want to know when they were submitted to BOA exactly. For I want to be sure the bank did not predatorily wait for a moment when no funds were available in my account to put the checks through or time them sequentially in such a way to cause my overdraft. In addition, I 'd like for BOA to lower the maximum fee they charge for NSF transactions to {$25.00}. Lastly, I 'd really appreciate at least a partial return of the fees charged to my account since I 've been banking with BOA. Since {$35.00} - {$25.00} is equal to {$10.00}, I 'd appreciate {$10.00} for every fee over the years. Lastly, I 'd like a thank you for bailing it 's \" too big to fail '' XXXX out of complete destruction and for not prosecuting anyone on its board for treason against all Americans back in 2008. \n",

After several attempts to get information, I finally just looked up the required documentation on their website. I completed the forms and submitted everything that was required directly through their website. I called the next day to make sure they were recieved and was told they were. The servicer was showing that we had entered a consent judgement which we had not. They had initially refused to process any loan workouts due to the consent judgement. The gentleman I spoke with indicated that he had the consent judgment closed out and had a loan modifcation opened for our account. I was told to just show up for trial and tell the judge that we were working on a loan modification, that there was a miscommunication with the servicer and their attorney re the consent judgment but that we were working on the modification now. THIS is not how it works. A judge isnt going to listen to me. Their legal team needs to take care of that considering THEY are the ones bringing the complaint. I was asked to submit copies of my XXXX and XXXX tax returns within the next few days to the servicer for the loan modification which I did. I called back today to make sure the documents were received. They were. However, I was advised to call the banks attorney to have them cancel the trial date. Again, the servicer needs to call their OWN attorney. Their attorney is not going to listen to me. The servicer is the one directing the foreclosure, NOT ME. I decided against calling the servicers attorney since I myself have an attorney and would not be allowed to speak with servicers attorney anyway. I called SPS again this afternoon and was told that MY attorney needs to call theirs to have the trial date cancelled. I told her they needed to direct their own attorney. I told the agent that I was aware of a federal regulation indicating they were supposed to postpone this trial date if we had a loan modification in progress and offered to give her the information. The agent indicated that she was unaware of any such law and put me on hold to ask her supervisor. She came back and advised that neither of them had ever heard of that law and that I needed to have my attorney call theirs. She stated even if she transferred me to someone else at SPS, they would tell me \" hands down that your attorney needs to contact our attorney. '' Again, I am insanely confused how my attorney is going to make them stop a trial date considering they are working for the servicer! In addition, she stated that they did NOT have a modification open on our account, even though I was told last week that they had opened the modification request ( and the agent had asked me to submit my tax returns ). Today, I was advised that they couldnt process a modification until they had all the paperwork. I advised that I had submitted docs last week and then the tax returns today, no one has asked me for any other documents. She did see all the docs but that they couldnt process the modification request until all the documents were received. I asked what documents were needed and she stated she couldnt tell me that, that the file had to be reviewed first. I am so confused. I am simply trying to work this out and the servicer is telling me many different things and refusing to work with me or postpone their trial date. \n",

Per a reading of the terms and conditions on the statement, payments are posted first to the higher interest balances and then the excess to the promotional balances. For the statement ending XXXX/XXXX/2016 I had a promotional balance of {$760.00} ( expiring XXXX/XXXX/16 ) and a non promotional balance of {$600.00}. I sent in a payment of {$670.00} on the due date. The a portion of the payment was correctly applied with {$600.00} against the non-promotional balance, however the excess of {$65.00} was applied against yet unbilled non-promotional balances. Under this application, if a consumer is using the card for purchases during a billing cycle, it becomes nearly impossible to payoff the promotional balance. A reasonable individual would understand and expect that if he pays off the entire non-promotional balance and sends additional funds, that these additional funds would be applied towards the promotional balance. \n\nBarclay customer service explained that this is not how it is handled as the yet unbilled non-promotional charges COULD be subject to a higher interest rate than the promotional balances, thus they are paid first, to protect the customer. In reality, this does not protect the customer but creates a scenario when the customer 's promotional balances does not decrease over time and the entire promotional balance must be paid in the final two months in order to avoid paying all of the accrued, yet unbilled finance charges associated with the promotional balances. \nWhile this could be argued is in keeping with the disclosures, it is both morally and ethically deceptive. \n",

It appears that they are using tactics that may be violating consumer protection law in debt collection practices depriving consumers of their rights to dispute. \n\n1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ). \n\n2. The company responded with a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by sending me a bill with a due date for XXXX. I had requested a bill showing what my balance was back when I made a payment back in XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. I was disputing the amount owed, disputing the charges. \n\n3. I wrote back to the company and faxed another dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX continue to dispute the amount owed. \n\n4. The company sent me a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX saying that they furnished me the information, I was not disputing that I owe XXXX XXXX, I was disputing that the balance was inaccurate and that I needed proof of the last known charges and activity on the account which was XXXX XXXX. In the last paragraph of their letter it indicated that if I was disputing the amount to send a letter and so on.. \n\n5. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. \n\nThe company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk 's office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. \n\nFacts:1.

The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. \n4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. \n5. I went the court house and the clerk 's office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk 's office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons. They filed a false affirmation with the clerk 's office. \n",

I called the bank right away around XXXX XXXX at the same date to report this. On XXXX when I got more detail about the transactions I called XXXX because the money were sent to someone named XXXX XXXX at XXXX. XXXX 's fraud department manager XXXX was able to find the transactions and found XXXX XXXX ' XXXX account was involved with fraudulent activities. Here is the direct quote from his letter to USAA ( I also can provide the whole letter if needed ) '' We investigated the transactions and found that the transactions were initiated by someone who had access to XXXX XXXX 's online banking. The XXXX Account that received these funds has been confirmed to be engaged in malicious activity, resulting in a permanent restriction of our services to them. I can also confirm that there are no apparent ties in between XXXX XXXX and the XXXX Account Holder that received these funds, meaning that it is highly unlikely this is a case of collusion. '' However, USAA called me back eventually and told me this is a scam. And if they ca n't retrieve money from XXXX, we were held liable for the loss. They said I am liable because I authorized these transactions. I asked how you can show I authorized the transactions such as which device they were initiated from but they could n't provide me with an answer. So I was accused of stealing money from my own account and they ca n't provide me any proof. Thus they used this to deny to reimburse me back. I request an appeal but they said the case was already reviewed twice and they refused to look into again. Therefore I am bringing this to legal actions. I feel this is the only resort left to get my money back. \nI am also filing wrongful accusation, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and incompetence against USAA based on the grounds below : 1 ) USAA accused me I was trying to scam money from my own account but at the same time they refused to show me any proof. ( Phone conversations happened XXXX around XXXX ). 2 ) USAA would n't do anything to stop further loss when I reported the unauthorized transactions. I have to request to transfer the money out and block my online access so the criminal ca n't continue to access my account. And they still keep my account 3 ) The investigation was not done thoroughly. They never contacted me or XXXX for any questions during the investigation. I contacted XXXX myself and they pin pointed the fraudulent activities. I also confirmed with XXXX that USAA never contacted them in regard of this. I was called XXXX ( XXXX ) by investigator XXXX from USAA saying that she just started the investigation and she left that day around XXXX. The next business day around XXXX in the morning she called me and saying the investigation was done and I was liable. They also told me they were trying to retrieve money from XXXX but nothing was done. The bank 's mobile app had security flaws and I believe this could cause someone stole my information and money without my acknowledgment. I have detailed proof on this and I can show upon further request. I reported this problem to USAA and they told me they were going to look into it but I never hear anything back after that. 4 ) Each time I called USAA I got transferred at least XXXX XXXX XXXX times and I still ca n't reach to the right person. The reps on the phone were contradicting each other each time I called. They also told me I should get a result with in 48hours but I was called the XXXX time after 53 hours that they just started the investigation.

I have seen homes foreclose within a year or so, and mine has been over 7!!! Can you please help??

In XX/XX/XXXX we refinanced our mortgage with Bank of America to a Home Equity Line of Credit ( HELOC ) with the following terms : the first 10 years were interest only and then a XXXX period of interest and principle would start. We refinanced this way so that we could access equity in the home for a new business my husband was starting. We intended to refinance the loan before the 10 year draw date had expired. In XXXX XXXX we were notified by Bank of America that the loan was going to convert from the draw period to the repayment period in 1 year and that the mortgage payments would increase from {$2000.00} ( interest only ) to {$8000.00} ( interest and principle ). They stated in the letter that if we could not make the {$8000.00} payment, we could apply for a home loan modification. Since we had intended to refinance anyway we began that process XX/XX/XXXX but we were unsuccessful because we found out that our property value had decreased by {$350000.00}. So we started the home loan modification process with Bank of America. Unfortunately, Bank of America has you work with a frontline representative who relays messages from the Underwriter who evaluates your financial information for the home loan modification. It took 3 months to get information entered and resolved when a 30 minute discussion would have resolved any additional document requests and questions. Documents were \" not received '', questions were re-asked on a number of calls, we spoke with at least XXXX frontline representatives since they can all assist each other so many times I was speaking with someone unfamiliar with our case. Needless to say, we were not approved for a home loan modification but we were approved for a short sale of the property. We were not approved for a home loan modification for XXXX reasons : we are currently not in default and therefore do n't qualify for some of the programs and we have insufficient income for the remaining programs. Bank of America gives you the option of appealing the decision within 30 days of the date of the result letter. Our letter dated XXXX XXXX, does n't arrive until XXXX XXXX. I did call to find out about appealing the decision and actually spoke with someone that could converse on our qualifications. We found out that they did not include income my husband receives from XXXX of the businesses because we could not provide a quarterly balance sheet. I was then told that I would have to reapply for the home loan modification in order for them to consider new income. But, of course, the new mortgage payment of {$8000.00} would be used instead of the {$2000.00} payment in the original application. We also disagreed on how they calculated our monthly income as well. We did go ahead to file an appeal and are now waiting to get that process going with a whole new set of representatives. This has just been a very frustrating process and it certainly seems evident that Bank of America has no wish to do any sort of home loan medication. It makes no sense to not work with a customer who is and has always been paying on time. And certainly for us to continue to make {$8000.00} mortgage payments will drive us into default but it is so obvious that this is completely needless. \n",

In order to resolve that issue some bills where not paid on time .. which would include the credit card for which I have the complaint with. My account is up to date and even though my payment was late it was not 30-60 days past due which is what they reported on my credit which had a very significant impact and I am currently trying to improve my credit in order to be able to buy a home. When I called them to discuss this and requested that they show me a courtesy of removing the delinquency from my credit as my account was paid and is up to date and this was the only instance for which I was late, as I always pay before my due date. I was told that they can not remove the delinquency from my report as they have no way of reversing the report they submit to the credit bureaus. I informed them that I have spoke with the credit bureaus and know that they can electronically respond to my dispute I made with them the previous day and the credit bureau stated once they receive that response it will up date immediately so if I need it removed soon to contact the company directly. So again the agent continues to repeat annoyingly over and over we can not change what we submitted unless we made the error. They proceeded to tell me if I had a dispute I would have to file it with them personally in writing and mail it to their dispute center and wait for them to review and make a decision which will take 30-60 days maybe up to 90 days. I kept explaining that their negative report affected me within a minute of them reporting it and can just as easily reverse it, if they would be willing to extend me that courtesy, however, they would not. I asked for another supervisor as the one I was talking to kept talking over me and saying the same thing over and over, she then placed me on hold for 15 minutes when another woman came on the line I explained the situation yet again. She stated well since you admitted to being a little late there was no error on our part, I said a little late is not 30-60 days delinquent but irregardless I was simply asking for a one time courtesy since I have never had a late payment ever and as a matter of fact they were always paid early. She agreed that this has never happened before on my account but still continued telling me that I would now need to submit my complaint in writing and mail it to them, even after I told her that I filed a dispute with the credit reporting agency and all they need to do is respond. When I mentioned I was filing a complaint with CFPB she then stated now I have to transfer you to the president line and immediately did so, and where I got a voicemail asking me to leave a name and number and a brief description of the issue.

Neither my wife nor I were able to obtain employment at that time. And access to any unemployment benefits had lapsed. The bank 's actions ( or lack of ) to obtain a loan modification or seek financial assistance has only made our financial situation worse -- and more stressful on the family. \n\nWe have literally spent hundreds of hours of filling out forms, collecting statements and faxing XXXX-plus pages of documentation to them at a time. It felt at times as if the bank was attempting to coerce us to short-sell and play on one 's own fears during times of great stress. Phone conversations with bank staff show a pattern of negative suggestive type statements rather pursuing a constructive plan of action and possibilities. Questions by bank staff were asked in a manner as to not divulge options readily. For example, questions about our intent to sell the house or confidence in finding work, were carefully asked before any mention of the loan modification program was made. \n\nOur inability to move forwarded after 2-years with a loan modification, even after several petitions, raises into question the bank 's intent of genuinely completing a loan modification -- even though it 's associated with a Federal HAMP program. Even after showing a full rebound in income in XXXX and obtaining a full-time professional position in XXXX with a large multi-national company, the bank 's actions have not changed. \n\nThe bank 's actions have only changed upon contacting our state 's Attorney General and one our Senator 's for assistant. This included having the bank stop the robo-phone collection calls, calling from unrecognized phone numbers, claiming to lost or not have received the paperwork, not willing to correspond via email as the process evolved and more. Or, when the town considered placing a lien on the property for real estate taxes has the bank ever disbursed funds of any kind. If the town placed a lien of the property it takes precedence over the bank 's debt claims We have provided the bank with an extensive amount of personal information through the submission of bank statements in full. It is possible, for example, to assess our family 's medical care activity by scrubbing these bank statements. In return, the bank has provided no information in regards to a proposal of any kind or even articulating the financial concerns they may have. \n\nInstead, the bank has returned our checks when attempting to make a payment. The claim being they will not accept payment unless it is of the amount specified. Which is impractical upon initially regaining employment and beginning to financially recover. At this time our mortgage payments are not accepted and the loan modification process is beginning again -- for the sixth-plus time. This unfortunately goes against our credit and falsely creates the appearance that we are not making attempts to rectify the situation. \n\nWe consider these loan modification actions to be nothing short of predatory, fraudulent and negligent given the process is tied to a federal program. Especially in light of the fact that the banking industry itself was bailed out by the federal government at a never before seen level of support. As a family, however, from the bank 's perspective, we are not to be afforded a similar opportunity to financially recover. \n\nNevertheless, we remain optimistic that a loan modification will obtained. Our primary request is that the process be fair and equitable and that by filing this complaint it will bring a sense balance to the situation. \n",

Now this is complete, absolute and utter XXXX -- they do n't reach out to the consumer, send a letter advising that this is about to happen or anything -- they just simply close down a credit account that has been active and in good standing for 3 or 4+ years. \n\nNobody from Kay was in any position to help me whatsoever or help fix the issue, and now they 've not only lost a customer for life but they went ahead and shut down a {$6400.00} credit line that I had every intention of continuing to use. \n\nIt is absolutely heinous to me that they have absolutely no requirement or responsibility to the cardholder to advise them of something they will be doing that can so negatively impact their credit reports. Moreover, the complete apathy from Kay staff was disgusting. \n",
